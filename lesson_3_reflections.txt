When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work with someone else on my project.
When I work on multiple computers.
When I want to share my project with the world.
To have a backup of my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you are working an a project and don't want to be interfered by the commits
in the remote. It is much easier and not so time consuming to merge all
files at the end.
