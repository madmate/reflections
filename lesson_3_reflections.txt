When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work with someone else on my project.
When I work on multiple computers.
When I want to share my project with the world.
To have a backup of my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you are working an a project and don't want to be interfered by the commits
in the remote. It is much easier and not so time consuming to merge all
files at the end.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I can fork a repository to my own account and then clone it to work on it. You will do that
to work on this project independently from the origin owner of this repository.
Clones are just the same repository you cloned from. Branches you use to develop a
new features independently from you stable version. You don't need to fear to break something
in the stable version when you work on a branch. When everything works you can merge.
If you want to integrate you changes into the original repo you forked from you push the changes to your repo and then
ask the owner of the origin repo to merge your version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work with the latest code base which gives you the advantage that you
can implement new features on the newest version and that they work the best with the
newest version. When you work with a old version you probably code something that is
already present in the newest version, but you don't know from it.
