How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

In the staging area are the files I want to commit next.
The staging are can only contain some files of the working directory.
Before files are in the repository they needed to be added to the staging area.

When I make changes to different files I can divide them logically
into several commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Add the files which are holden logically together, commit them and repeat.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Organize new features in branches and try them out there without touching the master version.
When they work you can merge them to the master branch. When not you can leave them in their branch.
The new feature did not worked out but you don't messed up the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

When something is graphically visualized you can understand the connections
between the branches and commits better.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The changes made in both branches will be merged in one branch. The content of one branch is added
to the other.
